    "explanation": "**Immutable Strings.** Strings cannot be changed. This loop creates 10,000 distinct string objects on the Heap, each one slightly larger than the last, and discards them immediately. This triggers massive **Generation 0** Garbage Collection pressure. **Solution:** Use `StringBuilder` to modify a single mutable buffer."

    "explanation": "**Memory Locality.** `structs` are Value Types. An array `TradeTick[]` is allocated as a single contiguous block of memory (efficient cache hits). A `class` array is an array of references (pointers) to scattered objects on the Heap, causing Cache Misses and GC overhead."

    "explanation": "**Boxing.** `42` is a value type (`int` is on the stack). Passing it to a method expecting a reference type (`object`) forces the runtime to allocate a new object on the Heap to wrap the integer. This generates unnecessary garbage. **Fix:** Use Generics `Log<T>(T data)`."

    "content": "In the .NET Garbage Collector, what happens to an object in **Generation 0** if it survives a collection sweep?",
    "explanation": "It is promoted to **Generation 1**. The GC assumes \"objects that survive are likely to live longer\". If it survives again, it moves to **Generation 2** (Long Lived). Gen 2 collections are expensive (blocking), while Gen 0 is fast. Optimization goal: Die young (Gen 0) or live forever (Gen 2)."

    "explanation": "**No.** Objects larger than 85,000 bytes go directly to the **Large Object Heap (LOH)**. The LOH is distinct because it is (by default) **Non-Compacted**. Frequent LOH allocations cause **Heap Fragmentation**, leading to OutOfMemory errors even with free RAM available."

    "explanation": "**Memory Windows.** `Span<T>` handles a `(pointer + length)` tuple. It points to the *existing* string's memory. Slicing just creates a new Span (stack struct) with an adjusted pointer and smaller length. No new Heap String is ever created."

    "explanation": "Use `WeakReference` or `WeakReference<T>`. A standard reference is \"Strong\", preventing GC. A WeakReference allows the Garbage Collector to reclaim the object if memory is tight, but lets you access it if it hasn't been collected yet. Ideal for large caches."

    "explanation": "**Premature Materialization.** Assigning the `DbSet` to `IEnumerable` forces **Client-Side Evaluation**. EF Core pulls *all* rows into memory first, then filters them in C#.

    "explanation": "**Yes.** This is called **String Interning**. The CLR maintains a pool of unique literal strings to save memory. Both variables point to the same object in the Intern Pool. **Caveat:** Runtime-generated strings (e.g., `new StringBuilder().Append(\"he\")...`) are NOT interned automatically."

    "explanation": "By default, it **wraps around** silently (e.g., becoming negative) because C# runs in `unchecked` context for performance. To prevent silent data corruption, wrap critical math in a `checked { ... }` block, which forces an `OverflowException`."

    "explanation": "It solves the **Visibility Problem**. Without `volatile`, the CPU might cache the flag's value in a local register, so the loop thread never \"sees\" the update from the main thread. `volatile` forces every read/write to go directly to main memory."

    "explanation": "**Compile-Time Constants.** `const` values are \"baked in\" to the call site at compile time. The client app literally has the number `1` embedded in its IL. You must **recompile the client**. Use `static readonly` for runtime value resolution to avoid this versioning issue."

    "explanation": "**Allocation Reduction.** `Task<T>` is a class (Heap Object). If your method frequently completes synchronously (e.g., retrieving from a memory cache 99% of the time), forcing a Heap allocation for every call is wasteful. `ValueTask<T>` is a struct, avoiding this GC pressure on the hot path."

    "explanation": "**Yes.** Extension methods are static methods under the hood: `MyStaticClass.MyExtension(myObj)`. Since you pass `myObj` as an argument, the method runs. This allows you to write safe null-checkers like `if (s.IsNullOrEmpty())`."

    "explanation": "Not always. If the lambda captures **closures** (local variables), it must allocate a \"Display Class\" to hold them.

    "explanation": "**Factory Method** creates one product (e.g., `CreateButton()`). **Abstract Factory** creates families of related products (e.g., `CreateUITheme()` which creates Buttons, TextBoxes, and Windows that all match). It is a factory of factories."
