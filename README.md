## ✨ Features

### 🎮 Gamified Learning

-   **Career Progression**: Level up from "Intern" to "Principal Architect" as you study.
-   **Streaks**: Track your daily consistency with a visual streak counter.
-   **Visual Rewards**: Celebratory confetti and toast notifications keep you motivated.

### 🧠 Smart Study Sessions
-   **Smart Shuffle**: Algorithm that prioritizes new cards and past mistakes.
-   **Sequential Mode**: Review questions in order (e.g., #1001, #1002) for systematic learning.
-   **Custom Limits**: Set exactly how many questions you want to review in a session (default: 15).
-   **Focus Modes**: Quickly jump into a "Mistakes Review" or "Bookmarks" session.

### 📊 Modern Dashboard
-   **Multi-Select Sorting**: select specific topics (e.g., "C# Internals" + "Security") to create custom decks.
-   **Category Filtering**: Sort categories by **Most Questions**, **Fewest Questions**, or **Natural Order**.
-   **Difficulty Badges**: Instantly identify <span style="color:red">**Senior**</span> vs <span style="color:purple">**Principal**</span> level content.
-   **Browser View**: Searchable list of all questions with "Sort by ID" and bookmarks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
